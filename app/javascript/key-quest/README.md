## Description

Welcome to Key Quest, an intergalactic typing adventure! In this game, you journey through the cosmos as a space explorer, encountering various challenges that test your typing skills. Whether it's dodging asteroids with quick keystrokes or communicating with alien species through precise typing, Key Quest offers an engaging and educational experience for typists of all levels.

This is mostly a cute game project to practice using React, Typescript, React Query, ChatGPT and to have some fun!

## Demo

Try the game [here](https://cosmic-noir.github.io/key-quest/)! Note this is a hobby project with bugs and features in development.

## Features

- **Dynamic Typing Challenges:** Encounter different typing tasks, from simple letters to complex words and phrases.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Choose your adventure's difficulty â€“ Space Cadet, Orbital Officer, or Star Voyager.
- **Progress Tracking:** Keep track of your typing accuracy, words per minute, and overall score.
- **State Management with React Query:** Utilize the powerful features of React Query to manage game data with local storage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running Key Quest, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

## Technology

This project is built using several modern web technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): An open-source language that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions.
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/): A library for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data in React.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/): A powerful professional-grade CSS extension language.
- [tsparticles](https://particles.js.org/): A lightweight JavaScript library for creating particles.
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/): React UI framework with comprehensive suite of pre-designed components.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): Used in many steps of building this app, including _designing_ the steps to do it. Used to generate all of the images used in this project as well. I really just wanted to test how fast I could build something cute with AI.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Cosmic-Noir/key-quest.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
  cd key-quest

```

5. Playing the Game -
   - Start the game, select a difficulty and level. Surviving levels unlocks the next adventure.
   - Type the letters and words as they appear on the screen.
   - Try to maintain accuracy and speed to maximize your score.
   - Avoid letting words or letters strike the forcefield, which will reduce your health.
   - When the health bar reaches 0 or the timer runs out, the level will end. Win by surviving until the timer runs out.
